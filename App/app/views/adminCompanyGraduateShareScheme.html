        Our Graduate Share Scheme is a new initiative and the first of its kind in the world.
        It is an inter-company initiative managed by Oil Diversity Global encouraging companies
        to multi train there  graduates and/ or junior personnel in order to fast track them
        through the industry and provide International experience.  This not only encourages
        multi-discipline training but encourages companies to work in business collaboration together.
        This will all be facilitated and candidates matched with companies based on our clients
        requirements and end goal.  We will follow these journeys and promote through the homepage
        of our website as well as International press when the initiative launches in June 2019.
        Simply register your company and relevant contact below, and one of our advisors will be in
        direct contact with you.
